# Embedded C Project Automated Agent Workflow Prompt

Follow these steps every time the agent is run in this workspace:

1. **Code Review:**
   - Review all code files in the `src` folder line by line according to rules and give suggessions.
   - Provide suggestions for improvements if any rules are violated.
   - Modify the code to address suggestions if required.

2. **Build:**
   - Build the project using the provided build system (e.g., `make`).
   - Save the build output to `build.log` in the root directory.

3. **Unit Testing:**
   - If the build is successful, run all unit test executables together from the `tests` directory .
   - Save the unit test results to `test_results.log` in the root directory.
   - Analyze the unit test results and provide a summary of pass/fail status and any issues found.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Ensure you are in the root folder.
   - Generate Doxygen documentation:
     - If `Doxyfile` or `Docs` folder does not exist, create them automatically.
     - Ensure `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = Docs` in `Doxyfile`.
     - Ensure function call/caller graphs are enabled and Graphviz is available.
     - Run `doxygen Doxyfile` and confirm output is in `Docs/html/`.

5. **Summary:**
   - Summarize the results of the review, build, test, and documentation steps.
